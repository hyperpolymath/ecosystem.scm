== Executive Summary

ECOSYSTEM.scm is a declarative S-expression format for describing software project ecosystems and inter-project relationships. This document outlines the path to formal standardisation.

**Recommended Standards Track:** IETF Informational RFC

**Rationale:** Data interchange formats have strong precedent at IETF (RFC 7946 GeoJSON, RFC 5545 iCalendar, RFC 8259 JSON). The IETF process is well-understood, accessible, and appropriate for developer tooling formats.

== Standards Bodies Evaluation

=== IETF (Recommended)

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Aspect | Assessment

| *Fit*
| ✓ Excellent. Data format specifications are core IETF territory.

| *Precedent*
| RFC 7946 (GeoJSON), RFC 5545 (iCalendar), RFC 8259 (JSON), RFC 7763 (Markdown)

| *Process*
| Internet-Draft → IETF Last Call → RFC publication

| *Timeline*
| 6-18 months for Informational RFC

| *Cost*
| Free (volunteer-driven)

| *Requirements*
| Rough consensus, running code, community review
|===

*Track Options:*

1. **Informational RFC** (Recommended initially)
   - Documents existing practice
   - No mandatory implementation requirements
   - Appropriate for new formats seeking adoption

2. **Standards Track RFC** (Future)
   - Requires demonstrated interoperability
   - Multiple independent implementations
   - Appropriate after adoption grows

=== IRTF (Not Recommended)

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Aspect | Assessment

| *Fit*
| ✗ Poor. IRTF is for research, not operational specifications.

| *Purpose*
| Long-term research groups, experimental protocols

| *Verdict*
| ECOSYSTEM.scm is practical tooling, not research.
|===

=== ISO (Not Recommended)

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Aspect | Assessment

| *Fit*
| ✗ Poor. ISO focuses on industrial/manufacturing standards.

| *Timeline*
| 3-5 years minimum

| *Cost*
| Significant (national body fees, committee participation)

| *Process*
| Requires national body sponsorship

| *Verdict*
| Overkill for software developer tooling formats.
|===

=== W3C (Not Recommended)

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Aspect | Assessment

| *Fit*
| ○ Partial. W3C focuses on web standards.

| *Scope*
| Browser technologies, semantic web, accessibility

| *Process*
| Working Group → Candidate Recommendation → Recommendation

| *Verdict*
| ECOSYSTEM.scm is not web-specific; IETF is better fit.
|===

=== ECMA (Not Recommended)

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Aspect | Assessment

| *Fit*
| ○ Partial. ECMA standardises programming languages.

| *Precedent*
| ECMAScript, JSON (ECMA-404), C#

| *Process*
| Technical Committee sponsorship required

| *Verdict*
| JSON went ECMA path, but IETF is more accessible.
|===

=== OASIS (Alternative)

[cols="1,4"]
|===
| Aspect | Assessment

| *Fit*
| ○ Acceptable. OASIS handles structured information standards.

| *Precedent*
| AMQP, MQTT, DocBook, OpenDocument

| *Process*
| Technical Committee → Committee Specification → Standard

| *Verdict*
| Viable alternative if IETF process stalls.
|===

== Roadmap Phases

=== Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

**Status:** ✓ Complete

[cols="3,1,3"]
|===
| Deliverable | Status | Location

| Canonical specification file
| ✓ Done
| `ECOSYSTEM.scm`

| ABNF grammar (RFC 5234)
| ✓ Done
| `spec/ecosystem.abnf`

| JSON Schema
| ✓ Done
| `spec/ecosystem.schema.json`

| Internet-Draft
| ✓ Done
| `spec/draft/draft-jewell-ecosystem-scm-00.txt`

| IANA considerations
| ✓ Done
| `spec/IANA-CONSIDERATIONS.adoc`
|===

=== Phase 2: Community Review

**Timeline:** 1-3 months

**Objectives:**

* [ ] Publish draft specification for community feedback
* [ ] Gather implementation experience
* [ ] Refine grammar based on real-world usage
* [ ] Build reference parser/validator

**Actions:**

1. Announce on relevant forums/mailing lists
2. Create GitHub Discussions for feedback
3. Track issues and incorporate improvements
4. Document implementation notes

=== Phase 3: Implementation

**Timeline:** 3-6 months

**Objectives:**

* [ ] Reference implementation (Rust recommended)
* [ ] Parser libraries for major languages
* [ ] Validation tools
* [ ] Editor/IDE support

**Minimum Implementations for Standards Track:**

[cols="2,2,2"]
|===
| Language | Priority | Notes

| Rust
| High
| Reference implementation

| TypeScript/JavaScript
| High
| Web tooling, Node.js

| Python
| Medium
| Broad ecosystem

| Go
| Medium
| Cloud tooling

| Scheme/Racket
| Medium
| Native S-expression support
|===

=== Phase 4: IETF Submission

**Timeline:** Month 6-9

**Actions:**

1. Create IETF Datatracker account
2. Submit Internet-Draft via https://datatracker.ietf.org/submit/
3. Request review from ART (Applications and Real-Time) Area
4. Respond to reviewer feedback
5. Iterate on draft versions (-01, -02, etc.)

**Draft Naming Convention:**

* Individual submission: `draft-jewell-ecosystem-scm-XX`
* If adopted by WG: `draft-ietf-<wg>-ecosystem-scm-XX`

=== Phase 5: IANA Registration

**Timeline:** Upon I-D acceptance

**Actions:**

1. Expert review of media type registration
2. Submit registration via https://www.iana.org/form/media-types
3. Await IANA processing
4. Verify registration in media types registry

=== Phase 6: RFC Publication

**Timeline:** Month 12-18

**Milestones:**

1. IETF Last Call (2 weeks)
2. IESG Review
3. RFC Editor processing
4. Publication as RFC XXXX

== Success Criteria

=== For Informational RFC

* [ ] Clear, complete specification
* [ ] At least one working implementation
* [ ] No technical objections during Last Call
* [ ] IANA registration approved

=== For Future Standards Track

* [ ] Two or more independent implementations
* [ ] Demonstrated interoperability
* [ ] Adoption in production systems
* [ ] No IPR (intellectual property) encumbrances

== Governance Model

=== During Development (Current)

* **Maintainer:** Jonathan D.A. Jewell
* **Contributions:** Via GitHub Pull Requests
* **Decisions:** Maintainer discretion with community input

=== Post-RFC Publication

* **Change Control:** IETF (for RFC-track changes)
* **Community Input:** Via errata, new I-Ds
* **Versioning:** Semantic versioning for format; RFC numbers for spec

== Related Standards Coordination

=== STATE.scm

Sibling format for AI conversation state persistence.

* Coordinate media type family
* Share parser infrastructure
* Align versioning strategy

=== Potential Liaisons

* **schema.org:** Structured data alignment
* **SPDX:** License expression compatibility
* **OpenAPI:** API ecosystem description

== Risk Assessment

[cols="2,2,3"]
|===
| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation

| Lack of adoption
| Medium
| Build tooling, demonstrate value

| IETF process delays
| Medium
| Operate as de facto standard initially

| Competing formats
| Low
| Differentiate clearly, focus on niche

| IPR claims
| Very Low
| MIT licence, contributor agreement

| Format design flaws
| Low
| Community review, iterate before standardising

=== Informational RFC Requirements

1. Does not establish Internet standards
2. Documents information of general interest
3. Requires rough consensus
4. No mandatory implementation

== Appendix: Alternative Paths

If IETF is not pursued, alternatives in order of preference:

1. **De facto standard** - Publish, build tooling, let adoption drive recognition
2. **OASIS** - Submit as Technical Committee proposal
3. **Community Group** - Form working group (e.g., under Rust Foundation, CNCF)
